Hello there.
I graduated with a degree in telecommunication (specialization cybersecurity) from [Warsaw University of Technology](https://www.pw.edu.pl/engpw). 
During my college years I gained foundations in computer networks, databases and programming. In my projects I mostly use Java and Python, but learning something new is never a problem for me. 
You can find here some of the projects I participated in, but not all of them as I don't always have a git trace.

Projects present here are: Battleship - a simple, 2D online game, Business Trip and Car manager - multiinterface Angular application preventing unauthorized access, Replanned - which is an app designed during a HackYeah hackathon

My master thesis **Neural networks in the classification of malware basing on behavioral features** applies Convolution Networks to gained malware samples aiming to categorize them to one of 8 families basing on its features.
